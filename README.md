# Consuming the Chuck Norris API from ReacJS

This project is for demo purposes only, and is used to demonstrate a very simple approach to incremental software development.

It leverages a public API available [here](https://api.chucknorris.io/), which does return random jokes about our legendary Chuck Norris.

It displays the provided jokes in a Gameboy-like dialog style with a typewriter effect.
